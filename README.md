# md5-checksum
Check if md5 hash matches with another file online.

# usage
I recommend adding execution permisions, you can do this via this command:
```bash
chmod +x md5-checksum.bash
```
When executed, you can paste in a link to a file... after that, enter in the name to the file you want to verify. It will check if the file matches. <br> <br>
Example output: <br>
```
URI to File: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyzpw/sound/main/index.html   
File Name to Compare: index.html

MD5 hashes match!!!

MD5 of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyzpw/sound/main/index.html: 11c67152118af3b45ff22cc2aafc22a7<br>
MD5 of index.html: 11c67152118af3b45ff22cc2aafc22a7
